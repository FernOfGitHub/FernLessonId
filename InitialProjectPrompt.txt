I would like create a program similar to Duolingo but to learn how to identify ferns, then expand to other families and orders of plants. This program would be web based or phone based.

This is a brilliant concept. Ferns are notoriously difficult to identify because they lack flowers or fruit, making them the perfect "high-skill" entry point for a gamified botany app. By structuring your program like Duolingo, you can turn a dense scientific subject into a series of bite-sized, addictive challenges.

To build this, you should focus on translating botanical morphology (the study of form) into game mechanics.
1. The "Learning Tree" Structure

In Duolingo, you have "Units." In your app, these units would correspond to the taxonomic hierarchy.

    Unit 1: The Basics (Fern Anatomy): Learn the vocabulary of ferns. If a user doesn't know what a pinna or a sorus is, they can't identify the plant.

        Level 1: Frond vs. Stipe (The "stem" and "leaf").

        Level 2: Leaf Divisions (Is it pinnate, bipinnate, or tripinnate?).

    Unit 2: Reproductive Secrets (The Sori): Identifying ferns by the pattern of spore dots on the back of the leaf.

    Unit 3: Common Families: Grouping by family (e.g., Dryopteridaceae or Polypodiaceae).

    Unit 4: Identification Challenges: Photo-based quizzes using real-world data.

2. Gamified Learning Mechanics

To keep users engaged, you can adapt Duolingo’s core loops:

    The "Identify the Odd One Out" Game: Show three photos of a Western Sword Fern and one of a Christmas Fern. The user must tap the intruder.

    The "Sori Match": Drag and drop different sori shapes (circular, linear, kidney-shaped) to the correct fern species.

    The Spaced Repetition System (SRS): If a user consistently misses the Maidenhair Fern, the app will show it more frequently until they master its unique "fan" shape.

    Streaks & Leaderboards: "You've identified plants for 10 days in a row! You're in the Pteridologist League."

3. Recommended Tech Stack

Since you want this to be web and phone-based, a Cross-Platform approach is best.
Layer	Recommended Tool	Why?
Frontend	React Native (with Expo)	Write code once; deploy to iOS, Android, and Web.
Backend	Node.js or Python (FastAPI)	Python is excellent if you later want to add your own AI image recognition.
Database	PostgreSQL	Great for handling the complex relational data of plant taxonomy.
Plant Data	iNaturalist API	Provides access to millions of "Research Grade" photos for your quizzes.

4. Expanding the Taxonomy

Once the "Fern Tree" is complete, you can expand into other "Languages" (Taxonomic Orders).

    Level 1 (Ferns): The "Introductory Course."

    Level 2 (Gymnosperms): Conifers, Gingkos, and Cycads.

    Level 3 (Angiosperms): The massive world of flowering plants, broken down by Orders like Rosales (Roses) or Asterales (Daisies).
